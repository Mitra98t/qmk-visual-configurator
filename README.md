# QMK Visual Configurator

This is a web-based tool for creating keymaps for QMK Firmware. It allows you to easily create keymaps for keyboards, and then export them in a format that can be used by QMK Firmware.

## Disclaimer

I started working on this project because I wanted to have a visual configurator for my keyboards. I'm not affiliated with the QMK project, and this project is not an official QMK project.

Also i started by focusing on the most pressing features to me, so there are a lot of features missing. I'll be adding more features as I have time to work on the project. If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to submit a pull request.
